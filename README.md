# Stock_correlations

This is a collection of mini projects that I have been working on to develop my ability to work with financial data and learn more about how to do some basic analysis, as well as visuallise data. I've used both Jupyter Notebooks and Python3 to work on these projects.

I'm also currently working on a project where I calcualte and plot stock moving averages, recreating a classic moving average trading stratergy.

### Stock_Correlations:
- Libaries used: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, yfinance
  - This mini project helped me understand how to load in financial data, and how to use dataframes do some basic correlation calculations.

### Non_Interactive_Dashboard:
- Libaries used: math, numpy, pandas, seaborn, yfinance, plotly and dash
  -  This project enabled me to develop my ability to read/work with api documentation. It's a simple stock dashboard that produces a semi-interactive webpage for 2 stocks, with their stock data and correlation information.
  -   To further improve this project I plan to add a dropdown menu of stocks, allowing the user to compare against various other stocks.

### Efficient Frontier:
- Libaries used: numpy, pandas, scipy, plotly
  -  This project allows the user to input a porfolio of stocks as a list and returns the optimal portfolio weighthings based on risk/sharpe ratio.
  -  The goal of this project was to try to gain a better understanding of the maths that is used in finance. While there were alot of parts of this project that intially confused me, through research I was able to develop a better understanding of the some maths used, and also learnt more about how returns are calcualted.
